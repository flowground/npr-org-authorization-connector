## Description

A generated **flow**ground connector for the NPR Authorization Service API (version 2).

## API Description

The interface to our OAuth2 server

## Authorization

Supported authorization schemes:
- OAuth2

For OAuth 2.0 you need to specify OAuth Client credentials as environment variables in the connector repository:
* `OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` - your OAuth client id
* `OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` - your OAuth client secret

## Actions

### Show a web-based login/signup form to a user

> If the parameters passed to this endpoint are correct, it will redirect to `npr.org/oauth2/login` for the user to complete the sign-in.<br/>
> <br/>
> Currently acceptable values for `scope` are any combination of the following:<br/>
> - `identity.readonly` - for read-only access to the Identity Service<br/>
> - `identity.write` - for write access to the Identity Service<br/>
> - `listening.readonly` - for read-only access to the Listening Service<br/>
> - `listening.write` - for write access to the Listening Service<br/>
> - `localactivation` - for all access to the Local Activation Service<br/>
> <br/>
> It is generally suggested that you assume that you will need all of the current scopes in order to successfully implement an NPR One application.<br/>
> <br/>
> If the parameters passed in are NOT correct and the client passed in a valid `redirect_uri` parameter, the request will be redirected to `{{YOUR_REDIRECT_URI}}?error={{ERROR_TYPE}}&message={{ERROR_DESCRIPTION}}`.<br/>
> If the parameters passed are NOT correct and the client did not pass in a valid `redirect_uri` parameter, this endpoint will return the errors encoded as JSON objects (along with the corresponding HTTP status code -- usually 400).<br/>
> The latter is intended for development and debugging purposes -- in a real-world situation, errors returned as JSON objects are irretrievable by the client application, and thus passing in a valid `redirect_uri` is critical even for the purpose of capturing errors.<br/>
> <br/>
> If the user successfully logs in and authorizes the application, the request will be redirected to `{{YOUR_REDIRECT_URI}}?code={{AUTHORIZATION_CODE}}&state={{CSRF_TOKEN}}`<br/>
> <br/>
> If the user DENIES the application, they will be redirected to `{{YOUR_REDIRECT_URI}}?error=denied&message=The%20user%20has%20denied%20the%20login%20and%20access%20request&state={{CSRF_TOKEN}}`.<br/>
> This means that if your application flow requires a user to log in in order to proceed, it is up to you to give them the proper messaging explaining that the sign-in must be authorized in order to continue.<br/>
> <br/>
> Finally, please do not confuse an authorization code with an access token. Once your app has completed this flow, you will still need to call `POST /v2/token` in order to swap the code for a valid access token.

*Tags:* `authorization`

#### Input Parameters
* `client_id` - _required_ - The client's ID
* `redirect_uri` - _required_ - The client's URL to redirect to if the authentication is approved
* `response_type` - _required_ - The type of response; currently, only `code` is supported
    Possible values: code.
* `scope` - _required_ - A space-separated list of scope(s) requested by the application
* `state` - _required_ - A CSRF token generated by the client, to be roundtripped through the request for added security

### Initiate an OAuth2 login flow for limited input devices

> This flow should only be used by clients who cannot show a native webview or do not have advanced input controls. It is an alternative to `GET /v2/authorize`.<br/>
> <br/>
> Third-party clients will need to use one or the other of these two endpoints, but they will generally not use both.

### Create a new OAuth2 access token

> Please be aware that the required parameters are contingent on the `grant_type` that you select.<br/>
> <br/>
> For the `authorization_code` grant type, you are **required** to pass in the `code` and `redirect_uri` parameters. `service`, `username` and `password` parameters will be ignored.<br/>
> <br/>
> For the `client_credentials` grant type, you do not need to pass in any additional parameters beyond the basic requirements. `code`, `redirect_uri`, `service`, `username` and `password` parameters will be ignored.<br/>
> <br/>
> For the `device_code` grant type, you are **required** to pass in the `code` parameter. If you are a third-party developer, you are also required to provide the `scope` parameter; see the documentation for `GET /v2/authorize` for possible values. `redirect_uri`, `service`, `username` and `password` parameters will be ignored.<br/>
> <br/>
> For the `password` grant type, you are **required** to pass in the `username` and `password` parameters. The `code` and `redirect_uri` parameters are ignored.<br/>
> Third-party developers do not have access to this grant type.<br/>
> <br/>
> For the `refresh_token` grant type, you are **required** to pass in the `refresh_token` parameter. The `scope` parameter can optionally be used to request a different set of scopes than were used in the original request, but it **cannot** contain any scopes that were not previously requested. If not specified, then `scope` will be set to whichever scopes were used for the original access token request. If trading in an old non-expiring access token for a refresh-enabled token, set the value of `refresh_token` to the access token value and `token_type_hint` must be set to `access_token`. `code`, `redirect_uri`, `service`, `username` and `password` parameters will be ignored.<br/>
> <br/>
> The `temporary_user` and `anonymous_user` grant types are custom grant types created by NPR to suit our needs for functionality such as our &quot;try-before-you-buy&quot; experience. If you are a third-party developer, you will not have access to these grant types unless we have explicitly given you permission within our system.<br/>
> For these grant types, if you are a third-party developer, you are required to provide the `scope` parameter; see the documentation for `GET /v2/authorize` for possible values. `code`, `redirect_uri`, `service`, `username` and `password` parameters will be ignored.<br/>
> <br/>
> The `third_party` grant type is another custom grant type created by NPR to handle login via third-party providers such as Facebook and Google. If you are a third-party developer, you will not have access to this grant types unless we have explicitly given you permission within our system.<br/>
> For this grant type, you are **required** to pass in the `service` and `token` parameters. If you are a third-party developer, you are also required to provide the `scope` parameter; see the documentation for `GET /v2/authorize` for possible values. The `code` and `redirect_uri` parameters are ignored.<br/>
> <br/>
> If you are unsure of which grant type to select, assume that `authorization_code` is the one you want.<br/>
> <br/>
> Note that at this time, refresh tokens are an opt-in feature; however, in the future, they will gradually transition to being opt-out, and ultimately required for all clients. Our general guidance at this time is that if this endpoint starts returning refresh tokens for you, you are responsible for implementing the code to handle them appropriately in accordance with the OAuth 2.0 spec. For more information about our gradual rollout of this feature, please contact the NPR One API team.

### Revoke an existing OAuth2 access token

> Our implementation follows the proposed IETF specification [RFC-7009](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7009).<br/>
> <br/>
> If your client application offers the ability to for a logged-in user to log out, and you have access to a long-lived<br/>
> `client_credentials` token (i.e. you have generated one that you are storing securely for the lifetime of the entire app<br/>
> install), we suggest (but do not require) that you call this endpoint and revoke the access token belonging to the<br/>
> logged-in user as part of your logout process. If you do not already have a long-lived `client_credentials` token,<br/>
> please don't generate one just for the purposes of calling this endpoint.<br/>
> <br/>
> If you are building a prototype application, we also recommend that you use this endpoint to clean up access tokens<br/>
> that you generate during the testing of your app and do not intend to reuse.<br/>
> <br/>
> Note that revoking an access token will automatically revoke any refresh tokens associated with it, and vice-versa.

*Tags:* `authorization`

#### Input Parameters
* `Authorization` - _required_ - A `client_credentials` access token from the same client application as the token being revoked. Should start with `Bearer`, followed by a space, followed by the token.
